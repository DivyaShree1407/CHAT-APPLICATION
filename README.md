DESCRIPTION: ðŸ§¾ CHAT APPLICATION --A Chat Application is a real-time communication platform that allows users to send and receive messages instantly. In today's fast-paced digital world, chat apps are vital for social interaction, team collaboration, and customer support. This project focuses on building a basic but fully functional real-time chat application using modern web technologies and tools.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY USED : To build this application, we used the following tools and frameworks for both frontend and backend development:

ðŸ”¹ 1. HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript (Frontend)
HTML was used to structure the webpage, including the input fields, message area, and layout.

CSS helped style the chat interface with colors, spacing, borders, and fonts.

JavaScript handled frontend logic such as connecting to the server using Socket.IO, capturing the username, and displaying messages dynamically.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Node.js (Backend)
Node.js is a runtime environment used to run JavaScript code outside the browser.

It powers the server of our application, handling client connections and message broadcasting.

Node.js is known for its non-blocking I/O, which makes it perfect for real-time applications like chats.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Express.js
Express is a lightweight web framework for Node.js.

It helps create the server and define routes (e.g., serving the frontend files to the browser).

Express simplifies server-side logic and speeds up backend development.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Socket.IO (Real-Time Communication)
Socket.IO is the core technology enabling real-time, bi-directional communication between the client (browser) and server.

It works on WebSockets and automatically falls back to other methods if WebSockets arenâ€™t supported.

We used Socket.IO to:

Emit messages from the client,

Receive messages on the server,

Broadcast messages to all connected clients instantly.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Git & GitHub
Git is a version control system used to track changes in the project files.

GitHub is used to host the project repository, collaborate on code, and manage versions.

It allows for easy code sharing, backup, and collaboration with other developers.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Visual Studio Code
VS Code was used as the primary code editor.

It provides syntax highlighting, auto-completion, integrated terminal, and debugging tools that enhance productivity.

FEATURES:

Real-time message updates using WebSockets

Simple and clean UI

Unique usernames per tab

Backend running on Node.js

Responsive design for desktop and mobile
